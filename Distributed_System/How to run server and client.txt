How to run server and client?
1-Compile the code
2-Run the server
# Start the server first
java serverSide.Server
3-Run the client
# Open new terminal for each client
java client.Client
### Usage Flow
1. Start the server first
2. Run multiple client instances in separate terminals
3. For each client, choose user type:
   - Admin (a): Use credentials username: "admin", password: "123"
   - Driver (d): Register or login
   - Customer (c): Register or login

### Important Notes
- Server runs on port 5056 by default
- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- Default admin credentials are hardcoded (admin/123)
- Ensure no other application is using port 5056
- Run server before connecting any clients

### System Requirements
- JDK 8+ (recommended JDK 11 or 17)
- Minimum 2GB RAM
- Windows/Linux/macOS

### Troubleshooting
- If port 5056 is in use, modify the port number in Server.java
- If connection fails, ensure server is running first
- Check firewall settings if clients can't connect
